If you are looking to contribute >>>

the project is Documented using Sphinx ... google it and add comments to your code
If you are running the source code, edit the path in conf.py to be your project path
Ex: sys.path.append('/home/workspace/myproj/myproj')

Then simply type: make html  from within the main project directory >> the output html will be in:
/_build/html/doc-index.html
